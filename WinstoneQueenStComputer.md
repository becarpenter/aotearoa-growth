Note that the references to "ICL 1500" are strange. Surely the machine was a 1900 series? The ICL 1500 series was a series of transaction terminals introduced in 1977 (see DataPro report).

But there *was* an ICT 1500 "based on the American RCA 301" according to Lavington/Early British Computers, roughly contemporary with the ICT 1301. A new installation in 1966 seems unlikely. Also the photograph at http://www.chezfred.org.uk/ComputerXHistory/FirstComputers-2/1963-ICT1500-GeneralView.htm looks different.

and the kitchen sink:
