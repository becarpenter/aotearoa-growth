p 7:

2nd Treasury machine by end 1961.
Canterbury Uni and Griffin acquired machines in 1961. [Canterbury got an IBM 1620, but Griffins only bought a BTM 555 calculator]. 

1962: NZ Railways, Dept of Education [actually their 2nd machine, ICT 1301], Dept of Statistics

1963: BALM paints (i.e. Dulux); Bond and Bond; Shell; Air NZ; Gough, Gough and Hamar; Tasman Pulp and Paper [probably bogus - no record in the Fletcher archives]; the Broadcasting Council; Auckland Uni [IBM 1620].

19621019, Cabinet approved computer for DSIR at £150,000 to £200,00 [the Eliot 503 installed at VUW by 1965].

"By the end of the decade there were about 140 machines on about 130 different sites. Of these 42% were used by manufacturing or processing industries, 15% were used by banking and financial instituitions, and 15% by central and local government."

In later chapters, Beardon discusses the social impact of computerisation - concerns about privacy and intrusive bureaucracy (triggered largely by the Wanganui computer centre) and the observed correlation between computerisation and unemployment (which may of course be entirely coincidental). In 1985, he was able to write of "a second industrial revolution", caused by automation in general, not just by computing. [Also by 1985, microprocessors and desktop computers were available - the revolution had hardly started by 1975.]
For example, on p 72, between 1961 and 1971 there were only two substantial changes in employment by sector: Primary (agriculture etc) declined from 15.2% to 12.0%, and banking & finance increased from 2.6% to 5.8%.
Beardon also discusses (pp 89-90) the computerisation of "women's work". The fraction of the "unemployed who are female" increased from 10.9% in 1961 to 18.0% in 1971 and 34.9% in 1975.
