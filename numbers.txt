NZ Official Year Book 1960-67: no mention of digital computers.

NZ Official Year Book 1968: no data, just a mention under DSIR:

"The increasing sophistication of research applied to agricultural production is nowhere more evident than in the extent to which the Applied Mathematics Division is now involved in the design of experiments so that they yield the maximum information, and in interpretation of the results. The volume of research statistics being handled by the division's computer service is rapidly increasing."

NZ Official Year Book 1969-71: no data, just general statements repeated in the following years:

"The first computer was imported into New Zealand in 1960 and by 1968 the total had risen to 87. (By 1972 the total was estimated to be nearly 200.) In actual practice few computers are sold; they are imported by one of the large computer companies on behalf of the user who rents the equipment and pays importation charges of around three-quarters of the first year's rental (which for a medium-sized unit may be $50,000)... The demand for computers has come from Government departments, local authorities, universities, primary producer boards, private firms in industries such as printing, forestry, insurance, oil, food processing, electrical equipment manufacturing, building and construction, clothing, engineering, airways, banking, retailing, motor assembly, paint manufacturing, and stock and station agents. The State Services Commission has established a computer centre in Wellington to serve a number of Government departments, while small private firms use independent bureaus and those run by equipment suppliers. A computer advisory service for commercial firms is available from the Physics and Engineering Laboratory, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Private Bag, Lower Hutt."
