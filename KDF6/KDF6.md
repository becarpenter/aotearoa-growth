"Probably one KDF6 installed in New Zealand – See ref. 4]."

Ref 4 is:

contains informal anecdotes from various operators and programmers who worked
on KDF6 computers in London, Australia and New Zealand."

This person was working on ICL System 4 machines in NZ:

Great comment here that have taken me back some years. I joined English Electric Leo in early 1964 as a computer engineer. After training at Kidsgrove in Staffordshire UK I brought the KDF6 that I helped build in Systems Test down to the London Borough of Harrow. I spent a couple of years there before moving into System 4 training – 4-30 and 4-50 systems. I spent a couple of years with a 4-30 at RCA at Sunbury on Thames before being sent to NZ to support and train NZ based engineers in Wellington. The hardware team was at that time Syd Greene, Tom Denyer, Dave Plimmer, Fred Bonette and me Roy Bowman. Sadly Syd, Tom and Fred have passed away so of that team only Dave and I remain. We actually live in the same retirement village in Porirua and I see Dave frequently. At that time early 1969 we worked for EDS based in what is now Victoria. The building has long since gone but is where NZ Truth was produced. Later that year English Electric and ICT merged to create ICL But several of us were disenchanted by our new masters and left. I joined Control Data in their Plug compatible division. We built and supplied Peripherals that plugged directly into IBM 360 and 370 mainframes. We had some pretty large sites to look after Data Bank Government Computing services and more.

Sorry to have raved on for so long but this is part of my history"

But there *was* a KDF6 in Auckland:

"Neil | April 14, 2022 at 8:59 am

The Auckland KDF6 was in Princess Street, a short walk down the road from Auckland University. I worked there from 1970 till mid 1971 when I began my OE. I believe that the KDF6 was replaced by a Burroughs B2500 later that year."

Hi Roger, remember me?
I ran the service bureau operation at Electronic Data Services which was 50% owned by EELM and 50% by a NZ newspaper, from 1966 to 1969. I was supposed to be on secondment from EELM in the UK, with the option of staying on after 3 years or returning to the parent company. But during my tour ICT bought EELM and ICT already had their own subsidiary in NZ and the NZ subsidiary was split in two with the computer sales side merging with ICT and the bureau side was 100% taken over by the NZ company. So without my doing anything I stopped being employed by a UK computer firm and became employed by a NZ newspaper – one with a rather dubious reputation at that.
You will remember Joan obviously, living happily in Chantilly. Rupert Blake died a few years ago. Tony Vial and his new wife Margaret are in Wellington. Mike Moller was OK when I last heard from him a few years ago. I have lost track of the others."

"Neil Harsant | December 7, 2021 at 6:13 am

I worked for Tony Vial in EDS’s Auckland Princess Street office during1970-1971
All KDF6 programming was done in PAIR3 assembler. Usually programs were assembled once and then patched until working. We became adept at machine level octal coding writing “Instants” that could load and run direct from paper tape.
I think that the machine was 18 bit based, not 16 bits. I still have a reel of 3/4 Inch mag tape from that system. The Auckland system was originally from the Australian Egg Marketing board in Melbourne. Never did get to see the Wellington’s KDF6. My time on the KDF6 was a fantastic preparation for my career as a programmer.
I hope that somewhere there is a museum with a working KDF6. It was a grand machine.
I have some photos of the Auckland system if anyone is interested."

"Dave Brown | February 24, 2021 at 6:58 am

Had a hand in scrapping a KDF6 here in NZ many years back- cant recall where exactly it was located though. Must have been either Wellington or Christchurch. More probably the latter."

"Simon | November 6, 2020 at 12:10 pm

Hi Dave. Do you have any details of the KDF6 in New Zealand – eg name/location of site, approx. dates of delivery and/or final switch-off?

    Hi Simon, late reply sorry. I only recall the one KDF6. We arrived in 1964 and I believe my father was responsible for installation of the system for the Wright Stevenson company in Challenge House on the Terrace, Wellington. I don’t know when it was retired."

"Roger M Morrell | September 11, 2021 at 3:55 am

The one in NZ was probably delivered in late 63 or 64 . It was there when I started working there in 65. And i think it was still there when I went on an OE in 69 event though I was not working for them at that time. At about that EELM in the UK merged with ICL in the so what was ICL in NZ took over sales of new systems. Don’t know what happened to the service bureau business on the KDF6. The office was somewhere between Guzznee St and Able Smith St but the street layout has changed a bit since then."

"Dave Green | September 11, 2021 at 9:21 am

Hi Roger, Syd Green was my father’s name. I might be wrong with the details but I thought the KDF6 he worked on was in Challenge House on The Terrace, but I also remember there was an office in Cumberland Place which might be where you mention. I remember visiting the Foodstuffs site when they had the Spectra System.

Dave, I remember your father. Wright Stephenson was also a customer, that will be the Challenge House. , I think we did wool sale processing for them. . It is possible that they got their own computer at some point and he would have supervised. It comes back to me, I think they might have had their own programmers, I think his first name was Ernie. . Yes I mainly worked in the Cumberland Place office, that where the KDF6 was when I worked on it. . I always wondered what happened to everyone after I left NZ because I did not come back for quite some time . There was another engineer that worked with your father but I’m not sure if I remember his name.

Roger, yes two KDF6’s would make sense. I have pics of dad supervising the unloading of crates on the steps of Challenge House. John Denyer is the only name I recall of the engineers and there was a programmer named Martin Gregory. After the EE and ICT merger, dad stuck with ICL for a while then moved on to servicing phototypesetting equipment. He passed away in 2003. John Denver (his wife’s name is Margaret) worked for Amdahl for some time but has also passed. What part of the country are you in,? I’m in the central NI."
