[I have the docx file of this that Janet sent me some years ago.]

Published in ORAL HISTORY IN NEW ZEALAND, VOL. 27, pp 1-8, 2015 as Wellingtonâ€™s Computing Pioneers,

"All interviewees were of Pakeha ethnicity. Most had university education - two to PhD level. Four were born in New Zealand, four were immigrants, and all had spent time overseas..."

But nothing in the text helps for the 1960-75 period.

Going to the National Library that holds the non-digitised tapes of the interviews:
